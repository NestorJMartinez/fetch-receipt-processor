# Receipt Processor Submission

Hi Fetch Submission Team,

My name is Nestor Martinez and this repo contains my submission for the take home exercise. I've written this in Go, so typing `go run main.go` will run the server, and running `go test` will run the tests that I've made in [main_test.go](main_test.go). All of the API and point calculation logic is in [main.go](main.go), and [testjsons](testjsons) contains the jsons needed to test the calculatePoints() function that I wrote.

I've also linked my LinkedIn profile in case you want to know anything else about me. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing back!
